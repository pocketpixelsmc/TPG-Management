          We launched TPG Property Management as experienced investors in both multi-family and retail properties. Using the knowledge and
          infrastructure we developed while managing our own portfolio, we recognized an opportunity to assist other investors and property owners. By
          leveraging our hands-on property ownership experience, we offer comprehensive management solutions tailored to maximize property performance
          and streamline operations for our clients.
